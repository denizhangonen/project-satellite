# project-satellite

Welcome!

This project contains some "satellite" apps/features for the most of the apps out there such as Social Logins, Payments, Email Notifications, Push Notification, Reporting, etc. 

Just started working on this so I'll be posting progress here so that you guys would know which app/feature is ready to be used and all.

Feel free to use any of the code in this repo. 

Anyway, hope it would be helpful for you all, well, there is nothing at the moment so..., but yeah, cheers.
